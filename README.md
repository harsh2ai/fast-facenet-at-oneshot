# fast-facenet-at-oneshot

This repository is an implemantation of siamese network using one shot learning which can be found at Deeplearning.ai on coursera
 The implementation is inspired by two path breaking papers on facial recognition using deep convoluted neural network, namely FaceNet and DeepFace. 
 I have used pre trained model Keras-OpenFace which is an open source Keras implementation of the OpenFace (Originally Torch implemented) 
 
# For beginners
- [ ] Know about a to z about deep learning here [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- [ ] Watch the Convolutional Networks Specialization on Coursera, found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks). 
- [ ] Read all 3 lecture notes under Module 2 for Karpathy CNN course found [here](http://cs231n.github.io/)
- [ ] Watch SirajRaval's video on CNNs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTr3n7uBIuE&t=1782s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow&t=4s)
- [ ] Write out a simple CNN yourself (using no ML libraries)

## Tools 
- [ ] Watch CS20 (Tensorflow for DL research). Slides are [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html). Playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-EvyKpZjmQ&list=PLDuNt91tg0urwwTQNKyUbncSDvMEl74ww)
- [ ] Watch Siraj Raval's intro to tensorflow playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FmcHiLCwTU&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7EEME489DsI468AB0wQsMV)
- [ ] Read Keras Example code to quickly understand its structure [here](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/)

## For experienced programmers

- [ ] Read about one shot learning [here](https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/one-shot-learning-explained-using-facenet-dff5ad52bd38) and [here](https://blog.netcetera.com/face-recognition-using-one-shot-learning-a7cf2b91e96c)

## Getting started 
- capture your facial data from data capture file and after the data has been sucssesfully captured run the facial recognition file.

please do note that this is not the true implementation of inception network,This model has been designed keeping in mind the network architechture of Inception Network
